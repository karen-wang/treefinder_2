# treefinder_2


Usability/design tweaks:
- turn off/on the tree diameter filter
- use google material classes for sliders
- display total number of trees in selection 
- turn off A and B radii if you only want a single circle
- display the parameters of the query string in natural language
- hovering for trees that you mouse over
- change species search to not be substring but start of word
- real units for circle radius
- draggable A and B (?)
- filter color based on different species
- street name filtering instead of species name


Matt :  circle filtering
Karen: draggable circle radius



- all one circle cases (before placing for first time, after removing)
- prettify settings, header, etc.

- if no circles drawn, don't filter by circles
- if one circle drawn, filter by one
- if two circles drawn, filter by both
