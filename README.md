# treefinder_2


Usability/design tweaks:
- turn off/on the tree diameter filter
- use google material classes for sliders
- display total number of trees in selection 
x turn off A and B radii if you only want a single circle
- display the parameters of the query string in natural language
- hovering for trees that you mouse over
- change species search to not be substring but start of word
- real units for circle radius
x draggable A and B (?)
- filter color based on different species
- street name filtering instead of species name

- final design tweaks: change header, change style of circles/radii, change style of sliders
